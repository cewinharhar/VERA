The multi-omic analysis has found an elevated risk for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CLC). Based on metabolomics and proteomics. Mention the relevant proteins and metabolites necessary for this study. This is a snippet of a publication about CLC:
Proteins regulate many biological processes, and gene mutations could alter their expression. As well as serving as a source of potential biomarkers, the proteome is also the functional translation of the genome. Compared to the normal proteome, cancer proteome biomarkers are up- or downregulated; Thus, researchers have recently focused their attention on identifying differences between cancerous and normal cells in terms of their expression characteristics. To develop new classification tools for CRC, diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers must be developed to detect proteins involved in its development and progression and observe the effects of protein perturbations and modifications.

Many proteomic techniques have been employed in order to find putative diagnostic biomarkers. According to Ghazanfar et al. [102], protein expression in fresh freeze samples of colorectal cancer tissue (12 individuals) was analyzed using gel electrophoresis in combination with mass spectrometry, demonstrating that number of proteins has been upregulated in colorectal Cancer. These include actin beta-like 2 (ACTBL2). Another study by Hao et al. [103], using high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry, revealed that colorectal tumour tissue overexpressed dipeptidase 1 (DPEP1) Based on the examination of 22 pairs of normal tissues adjacent to cancerous tissue. Yamamoto and colleagues used a global proteomic approach to study formalin-fixed and paraffin-embosted (FFPE) CRC tissue with liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS). They found a higher concentration of cyclophilin A, annexin A2, and aldolase A in cancerous tissues versus non-cancer tissues [104]. Similarly, in another study, fibroblasts associated with cancer progression were identified from human and mouse tissue. As a result of this study, it has been demonstrated that the proteins LTBP2, OLFML3, CDH11, CDH11, CALU, and FSTL1 play an important role in the migration and invasion of CRCs and have been implicated as stromal biomarkers [105].

Among the potential biomarkers of colorectal Cancer, blood-based markers are some of the most promising for performing early detection and surveillance of CRC because obtaining the specimens is relatively easy and noninvasive with minimal risk [106,107]. A targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed on 213 healthy subjects and 50 colorectal cancer patients by Ivancic et al. [108]. This study identified five proteins, including inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy-chain family member 4, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, EGFR, hemopexin, and superoxide dismutase 3, that play a significant role in detecting CRC with 89% specificity and over 70%sensitivity. Furthermore, A protein panel for early detection of CRC was discovered by Bhardwaj et al. [109], by using liquid chromatography/multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry in plasma samples from 96 CRC patients, and 94 controls, using a blood-based profile of five markers, osteopontin, serum paraoxonase lactonase 3, transferrin receptor protein 1, mannan-binding lectin serine protease 1, and amphiregulin. Demonstrated promising performance in screening for colorectal Cancer. Additionally, a number of members of the Serpin family including SERPINC1 (antithrombin-3, AT-III), SERPINA3 (alpha-1 antichymotrypsin, AACT), and SERPINA1 (alpha-1 antitrypsin, A1AT), have been identified as potential biomarkers for colorectal carcinoma and adenomatous polyps by using multiplexed quantification isobaric tags for absolute and relative quantitation (iTRAQ), [110]. The importance of CC chemokines (CCL15, CCL4 and CCL2) has also been assessed in CRC however further research is needed for their utility as diagnostic and clinical markers [111].
