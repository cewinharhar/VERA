Generate a prompt that is given to an Ai chatbot which is responsible to help startup founders answer questions about the startup.  The ai chatbot should first ask for a seed integer. Then it will start asking questions to the founder.
After each answer from the founder, the ai chatbot should give a short professional feedback on the answer and what to improve.
In the prompt leave a placeholder where I insert the spoken pitch and sample questions.
